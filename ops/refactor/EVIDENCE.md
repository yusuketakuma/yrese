# Refactor evidence index

Updated on 2026-07-16. This file is the durable index for the active repository-improvement goal. It points to authoritative records instead of duplicating their full command output.

## Evidence authority

| Evidence class | Authoritative record | Current status |
|---|---|---|
| Repository structure and commands | `CODE_MAP.md` | CURRENT |
| Frontend/backend/API/persistence alignment | `FULLSTACK_ALIGNMENT.md` | PARTIAL; explicit blockers retained |
| Automated validation | `VERIFICATION.md` | PASS with documented environment limits |
| Browser and local-demo journeys | `FINAL_DEMO.md` | DEMO_REQUIRED |
| Resume point, blockers and rollback | `STATE.md` | CURRENT |
| High-risk changes | `HIGH_RISK_CHANGES.md` | Human gates remain authoritative |

## Landed evidence groups

| Work package | Implementation evidence | Ledger evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-0053 | `050df59` | `Plans.md` FHIR Native v0.5 section | Phase 0 through Phase 5 work split landed; approval gates remain closed |
| WP-4149 | `7ba1003` | `30bca4a` | Reception registration accepts only the selected Patient Context |
| WP-4150 | `87b5c41` | `f28921a` | Patient selection action remains reachable at narrow widths |

All commits above are pushed to `origin/agent/reconcile-wp9002-w7c-20260712`. Commit presence does not satisfy independent verification, human approval or final-demo gates by itself.

## Current browser evidence

- Environment: development API and Web servers, in-memory repositories, explicit development-only tenant stub, synthetic fixtures only.
- Patient/reception: patient search, selection, reception registration, queue reflection and context clear passed. The registration form has no freeform Patient ID input.
- Responsive: 375, 768 and 1280 CSS-pixel viewports had no page-level overflow. At 375, the patient-selection action remained inside the viewport before and after horizontal table scrolling.
- Audit success path: after a synthetic reception was created, `/admin` displayed `reception.created` and `audit.viewed`; the displayed hash chain was verified as normal.
- Browser console/page-error capture was empty for the completed patient/reception and responsive journeys.
- Production Web sequence: `next start` correctly rejected a preceding dev-format `.next`; `next build` then produced 12 static pages and `next start` became ready in 237 ms. `/sync-status` rendered its explicit disconnected/not-synced placeholder and the server shut down normally.

## Evidence not obtained

- Audit refresh failure retention is covered by the 50-test `audit-log-view.test.tsx` component suite, but not by browser evidence. Both network-abort interception and an immediate synthetic `fetch` rejection caused the browser automation session itself to stop responding before post-failure DOM capture. Those attempts are tool failures, not application pass or fail evidence.
- The reduced-motion browser setting did not report an active media query in the automation session, so no reduced-motion conformance claim is made. Forced-colors, 200% zoom focus flow and detailed network/hydration capture remain unverified.
- PostgreSQL integration, production API startup, real authentication, role/tenant denial and a production clinical journey remain unverified. The production Web static-route startup above is only partial evidence. See `FINAL_DEMO.md`.

## FHIR package pre-lock evidence

Retrieved on 2026-07-16 for WP-0053b research only. This is not an approved package lock.

| Item | Direct evidence |
|---|---|
| JP Core artifact | `https://jpfhir.jp/fhir/core/1.2.0/package.tgz` |
| Artifact fingerprint | SHA-256 `6094c8b9ebd975cb738c66cc999774c06a0aacf4480c068a8465e597117e52a3`; 2,391,515 bytes; server `Last-Modified` 2025-11-28; ETag `247ddb-644a0ac73f2c0` |
| Package identity | archive `package/package.json`: `jpfhir.jp.core#1.2.0`, FHIR `4.0.1`, canonical `http://jpfhir.jp/fhir/core` |
| Declared dependencies | `hl7.fhir.r4.core#4.0.1`, `hl7.terminology.r4#7.0.0`, `hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4#5.2.0`, `jpfhir-terminology.r4#1.4.0` |
| License metadata | archive `package.json` declares `CC0-1.0`; no standalone license/copying/notice file was present in the archive |
| Official pages | `https://jpfhir.jp/fhir/core/1.2.0/download.html`, `guide-general.html`, and `qa.min.html` |

Pre-lock discrepancies and stops:

- The rendered dependency table names `jpfhir-terminology#1.4.0`, while the downloaded archive declares `jpfhir-terminology.r4#1.4.0`. The exact terminology artifact, source, fingerprint and license remain unresolved.
- The archive `url` field contains a publisher build-machine `file://` path rather than the public canonical.
- The QA report shows zero errors/warnings but also reports suppressed issues, an unpublished publication status and missing version-history metadata. A green QA summary alone is insufficient approval evidence.
- The download URL is not content-addressed. Future retrieval must compare hash, byte length, HTTP validators and package metadata before accepting the same semantic version.
- FHIR/JP Core specialist and legal/license review remain required before any lock or runtime/toolchain implementation.

## Evidence rules

- Never use production credentials, PHI or real patient data in local evidence.
- A test proves only the path and invariant it asserts; component tests do not substitute for browser, database or production-like evidence.
- Environment/tool failures remain explicit and do not become green evidence.
- `DEMO_REQUIRED`, `VERIFY_REQUIRED`, human gates and expected PostgreSQL skips remain open until direct evidence closes them.
